==================

Follow the instructions of FCCSW: https://github.com/HEP-FCC/FCCSW

Clone the FCCSW repository: replace <username> by your github username:

    git clone git@github.com:<username>/FCCSW-hh.git FCCSW 


### GeoDisplay (DD4HEP)

Source the setup script:

    source /afs/cern.ch/exp/fcc/sw/0.1/setup.sh


Create build and install directories:

    mkdir build
    mkdir install
    cd build


Export install directory 

    export MYINSTALLDIR=../install

Compile and install

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${MYINSTALLDIR}  -DDD4HEP_USE_BOOST=ON -DDD4HEP_USE_XERCESC=ON -DXERCESC_ROOT_DIR=${location}/XercesC/3.1.1p1/x86_64-slc6-gcc48-opt -DROOTSYS=${location}/ROOT/v5-34-00-patches/x86_64-slc6-gcc48-opt -DDD4HEP_WITH_GEANT4=ON -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${location}/Geant4/9.6.p03/x86_64-slc6-gcc48-opt -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=${location}/DD4hep/v00-06/x86_64-slc6-gcc48-opt ..
    make -j 12
    make install

Export install dir to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${MYINSTALLDIR}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    export PATH=${MYINSTALLDIR}/bin:${PATH}


At this stage one can run geoDisplay to visualize the geometry being used. Always have the top file FCCDectOpt02.xml first, then just happend any detector (here only HCal_Barrel)

    geoDisplay -compact file:../compact/FCCDectOpt02.xml -compact file:../compact/HCal_Barrel.xml


Or alternatively run the GUI

    python ../script/gui.py

Do not forget to quit the ROOT window (.q) before running an other display


### Simulation (Geant4)

To run geant4 one has still to set a few environment variables to point to G4 data files

    export G4LEDATA=/afs/cern.ch/sw/geant4/releases/share/data/G4EMLOW6.37
    export G4LEVELGAMMADATA=/afs/cern.ch/sw/geant4/releases/share/data/PhotonEvaporation3.1
    export  G4SAIDXSDATA=/afs/cern.ch/sw/geant4/releases/share/data/G4SAIDDATA1.1  

at this point one can run FCChh_sim in batch mode:

    FCChh_sim file:../compact/FCCDectOpt02.xml file:../Hcal_Barrel.xml file:../compact/geant4.xml ../scripts/FCChh.in

or in (Geant4-like) interactive mode:

    FCChh_sim -i file:../compact/FCCDectOpt02.xml file:../Hcal_Barrel.xml file:../compact/geant4.xml ../scripts/FCChh.in


WARNING: the simulation part is being re-written to use DDG4, Geant4 interface in DD4HEP
